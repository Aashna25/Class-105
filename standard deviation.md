# Introduction to Standard Deviation

understand why the standard deviation is important and where it is used.

understand the formula for standard deviation, and write code for it.

In the last class, we learnt about how

we can calculate the mean, median and mode. The mean, median and mode are all statistical terms used to find the central tendency of our data, through which we can say that the tendency for random data points in a data set would be around the mean, median or mode.



Today, we are going to understand what this means, by plotting scatter plots for marks of students in two different classrooms.

We will write 2 python programs. One to calculate the mean and plot a scatter plot on marks of student for class 1, the other to calculate the mean and plot a scatter plot on marks of student for class 2.

We can say that the central tendency, or the average does not tell us much about the data. Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out a data set is. Without calculating the standard deviation of the data, we cannot know whether the data is close to average or whether the data is spread out over a wide range. So, letâ€™s see how we calculate the standard deviation.
